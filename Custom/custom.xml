<!--
This is the Create Custom level file. It sets the size of the level, what environment to use and all objects, such as vox-models, scripts and boundary, used in the level.
Positions are given in meters relative to their parent objects position. In this level no objects are parented and hence positions are in reference to the bottom center of the game world.
Voxbox sizes are given in voxels. One voxel is 0.1 meters on all sides.
This level contains a plain voxbox as indestructible ground and an empty vox file. Open the vox file in MagicaVoxel and create something, then load this level from the Create menu to see your creation in the game.
-->

<!--
The 'version' indicates what version of the editor was used to create the level. Leave it as is to make sure scripts are loaded as expected.
The 'shadowVolume' property sets the area of the game where lighting, and subsequently shadows, are calculated. It is expressed in meters; width, height, length
-->
<scene version="3" shadowVolume="200 100 200">
	<!-- 
	This sets the environment used for the level.
	The 'template' property references a predefined setup of environments. Available environment templates are: 'sunny', 'night', 'sunset', 'sunrise', 'foggy', and 'rain'
	-->
	<environment template="sunset"/>

		A voxbox is a basic box shape. By default it is indestructible.
		The 'pos' property sets the position of the box's top-upper-left corner relative to the bottom center of the game world, in meters. 
		The 'size' property sets the size of the box in voxels as; width, height, and length.

		A vox is a voxel model loaded from a vox-file.
		The 'pos' property sets it's position relative to the bottom center of the game world, in meters.
		The 'file' property references the vox-file to be loaded. The 'LEVEL' keyword is a reference to the folder with the same name as the level file i.e., The keyword 'LEVEL' in the basic.xml level file (this file) references the folder named 'basic'.

		These vertices defines the boundary of the game level.
		The 'pos' property sets the position of the vertex relative to the bottom center of the game world, in meters. As the boundary has infinite height the positions are only given relative to width and length, without height.
